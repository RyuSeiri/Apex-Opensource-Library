 * Abstract class used as basis to enforce uniform Trigger handling.
 * All triggers for individual SObject types should have one Trigger Handler class extending this class and provide
 * their own handling for each trigger event by overriding virtual methods.

 * This handler provides special behaviour for workflow field updates, which under normal circumstances execute trigger
 * with original old map. This handler uses new map from previous trigger run for optimization.
 * Logic classes will see only workflow field updates changes.
